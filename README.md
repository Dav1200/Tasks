# Tasks
Solution developed to help businesses manage tasks - for job application

Clone the project

Make sure to have Node installed - https://nodejs.org/en/download, as the application is built upon this.

In your favorite IDE or terminal type "npm install" this will install all dependencies.

To start type "npm run start"

for development to enable live reload type "npm run dev"

Due to the limited time I had, I focused more on functionality rather than UI/UX but still tried (Had to do in a single day)

To test api calls, try the functionality provided on the frontend.

The application uses express for the backend and vanilla frontend due to small scale.

For storage - I decided to go with local db sqlite3 which makes a db file in the directory, this was because it will provide the end user with minimal setup required. Everything is encapsulated in one place

Hopefully you like the application. Looking forward!
